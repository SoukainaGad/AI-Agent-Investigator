# 🕵️‍♀️ AI Agent Investigator

### 🔍 Overview

**AI Agent Investigator** is a Streamlit-based multi-agent OSINT system that investigates companies for potential relationships with defense contractors, military suppliers, or activities related to geopolitical conflicts — such as the military invasion in **Gaza and the West Bank**.

It automates **open-source intelligence (OSINT)** research using AI agents that search, analyze, and verify publicly available information.

### 🧩 What’s Includedd

* Automated **OSINT research** using AI agents
* **Researcher Agent** → finds and summarizes verified public data
* **Verifier Agent** → cross-checks claims and assigns confidence levels
* Context focus on **defense, military, and geopolitical links**
* Outputs results as structured **JSON**
* Export findings as downloadable `.json` reports

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a company name (e.g., `Nestlé`, `Microsoft`, `L’Oréal`).
2. The **Researcher Agent** searches the web (via SerpAPI) for public reports and documents.
3. The **Verifier Agent** checks evidence across multiple primary sources.
4. The system generates structured claims and confidence scores.
5. Results are displayed in Streamlit and can be downloaded as JSON.
